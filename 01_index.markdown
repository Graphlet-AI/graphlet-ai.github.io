            Graphlet AI is a data engineering, data science and artificial intelligence consultancy specializing in <i>knowledge graph construction</i>, also known as <b>property graph construction</b>. We transform and refine raw data on your data lake to build large networks ranging in the millions, billions or even trillions of nodes and edges that model entire business domains to solve complex problems with global footprints. We use big data tools and go beyond simple ETL by using machine learning and artificial intelligence to construct a graph model of your business domain that maps closely to solutions to your business problems. Using a modern graph database, your data science and machine learning teams can then efficiently mine this refined graph to find solutions to your most pressing data science problems.

How much ETL varies by industry from minimal with cybersecurity applications to simplified graph model with fewer makes it easy to access, query, analyze and model in a graph database such as Neo4j, TigerGraph or Neptune.</div>

        <h2 id="problem-definition">Why should I build a knowledge graph for my business?</h2>
        I'll let you in on a secret that is driving the popularity of enterprise knowledge graphs, property graphs, graph databases and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): MOST DATA IS GRAPH DATA. To compose a single table to get the corresponding vectors, matrices and tensors we load into GPUs to drive machine learning algorithms, several tables have usually been combined [squashed] into one table. There's a problem with this... it is a lossy process. We threw away the relationships. Graph neural networks are able to learn better to build more powerful models because they have a greater potential by matching the structure of the data’s entities and their relationships.

        <h2 id="problem-definition">Course Description</h2>
        In this course, we will take the skills you've developed in working with data tables and DataFrames and extend them to cover graphs, networks, knowledge graphs, property graphs and graph databases. We will work with different types of graphs from across problem domains. This includes natural networks like social networks, collaboration networks or communications networks as well as structural networks like the plan of a Python program or the 3D mesh of a model of a 3-dimensional scene.

        We will introduce common Python and R tools for graph analytics and graph machine learning as well as the most popular graph databases. We will focus on property graphs but will also compare them with RDF / triple stores using SPARQL. We will cover the core methods from social network analysis and network science that will guide your informed-intuition in doing graph machine learning. We will build a knowledge graph using natural language processing (NLP), combine its duplicate nodes using deep networks for entity resolution and mine the resulting graph for patterns. Finally, we will build a full-stack graph ML application that shows network visualizations of explainable GNNs for chemical engineering.
        You will graduate from the course able to work with graphs as you now work with tables and DataFrames.

        <h2 id="problem-definition">Who should attend this course?</h2>
        This course is for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to extend their work with data tables and DataFrames to datasets with a relational or graph structure - entities (nodes/vertices) and their connections (edges/links).

        Beginning with a grounding in theory and real-world use cases, we will build knowledge graphs using natural language processing (NLP), analyze networks using graph analytics and extract the full potential of relational structures in data by automating business procsses using graph machine learning including graph kernels, embeddings and graph neural networks (GNNs). When the course is completed, you will be able to incorporate graph machine learning in your daily work to build more powerful models and systems.

        <h2 id="problem-definition">What will students learn?</h2>
        Students will go from a working knowledge of data science and machine learning with data tables to a working knowledge of data science and machine learning for graphs to build real world applications. It is not enough to teach students graph neural networks (GNNs) - they need to work their way up from graph theory to GNNs using common Python tools in design patterns based on real world use cases.
        Students will learn to:
        <li>
            <ul>Build and extend knowledge graphs using natural language processing (NLP) named entity recognition (NER), information extraction and entity linking</ul>
            <ul>Describe social networks using social network analysis (SNA)</ul>

        <h2 id="problem-definition">Principal Consultant</h2>
        My name is Russell Jurney. I work at the intersection of big data, large networks - property graphs or knowledge graphs, representation learning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Understanding (NLU), model explainability using network visualization and vector search for information retrieval.
        I am a startup product and engineering executive focused on building products driven by billion node+ networks. I have worked at cool places like Ning, LinkedIn and Hortonworks. I co-founded Deep Discovery to use networks, GNNs and visualizations to build an explainable risk score for KYC / AML.

        I am a four-time O'Reilly author with 120 citations on Google Scholar for being the first to write about “agile data science” - agile development as applied to data science and machine learning. I am an applied researcher and product manager with 17 years of experience building and shipping data-driven products.
        I am currently fascinated by knowledge graph / property graph construction, graph representation learning, graph neural networks (GNNs), NLP/NLU techniques such as information extraction, named entity resolution (NER), coreference resolution, fact extraction, and entity linking. I do network science and machine learning - so I get stuff done :)

        <h2 id="problem-definition">Course Outline</h2>
        The course is divided into two sections: theory and practice.
        The theory portion introduces theoretical models for the course’s content along with real-world examples from science and industry of their use. If you don’t know the basis and relevance of a technique - why learn it?
        The practice portion works through the everyday work of implementing the topics covered in the first day using the most popular, effective tools for graph processing, graph databases and graph machine learning. We focus on Python but do a little R.

            <ul>Graph theory - what is a graph? Examples of networks? Heterogeneous networks can model anything!</ul>
            <ul>Data models - property graphs (yaaah!) vs RDF triple stores + SPARQL</ul>

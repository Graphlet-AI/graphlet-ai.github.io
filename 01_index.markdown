    The workflow for the knowledge graph factory described below defines the process that enables enterprises to embrace and extend the data platforms they already use to build an enterprise knowledge graph with a uniform ontology that represents the domain in which their business operates. On top of this domain specific graph they can then use graph intelligence to add the types of edges in the solution space that solve their business problems. In addition to network construction, a KG factory would allow companies to easily do graph search, graph machine learning, and the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs) to build a high fidelity model of their problem domain which can drive the models that automate their business processes under a Software 2.0 model as defined by Ratner, Hancock and Ré.<br /><br />

    Heterogeneous knowledge graphs offer a rich domain in which to model your market and its problems. When combined with heterogenous graphlets and motifs, motif search against null models and Motif Graph Neural Networks, they offer an efficient way to create automated solutions using representation learning that builds on top of the domain expertise previously expressed by an organization in the form of graph queries. These distributed representations of the problem domain of a market are the core assets that drive FAANG companies… and is causing other enterprises to follow them in transforming their companies to be model first, rather than code first.

        <h2 id="problem-definition">Why is there so much talk about knowledge graphs and GNNs?</h2>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 5%;">Knowledge graphs are at the peak of the Gartner hype cycle and graph neural networks (GNNs) are soon to be high on the ramp because they tap and unlock the potential of enterprise knowledge graphs. Data lakes put data in one place, knowledge graphs link datasets together and graph neural networks automate business processes using data from across an enterprise.<br /><br />

        Most graph databases are fast becoming cloud-based GNN platforms:

    <h2 id="problem-definition">What’s the real story?</h2>

    I'll let you in on a secret that is driving the popularity of enterprise knowledge graphs, property graphs, graph databases and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): MOST DATA IS GRAPH DATA. To compose a single table to get the corresponding vectors, matrices and tensors we load into GPUs to drive machine learning algorithms, several tables have usually been combined [squashed] into one table. There's a problem with this... it is a lossy process. We threw away the relationships. Graph neural networks are able to learn better to build more powerful models because they have a greater potential by matching the structure of the data’s entities and their relationships.

    <h2 id="problem-definition">Course Description</h2>

    In this course, we will take the skills you've developed in working with data tables and DataFrames and extend them to cover graphs, networks, knowledge graphs, property graphs and graph databases. We will work with different types of graphs from across problem domains. This includes natural networks like social networks, collaboration networks or communications networks as well as structural networks like the plan of a Python program or the 3D mesh of a model of a 3-dimensional scene.

<div>
    We will introduce common Python and R tools for graph analytics and graph machine learning as well as the most popular graph databases. We will focus on property graphs but will also compare them with RDF / triple stores using SPARQL. We will cover the core methods from social network analysis and network science that will guide your informed-intuition in doing graph machine learning. We will build a knowledge graph using natural language processing (NLP), combine its duplicate nodes using deep networks for entity resolution and mine the resulting graph for patterns. Finally, we will build a full-stack graph ML application that shows network visualizations of explainable GNNs for chemical engineering.

    You will graduate from the course able to work with graphs as you now work with tables and DataFrames.

    <h2 id="problem-definition">How long is this course?</h2>

    The course is spread over five half-days. The order of topics is:

    
    <div>
        <li>
            <ul>Day 0 - Before class, Platform Setup of the Docker, notebook Github software for the course.</ul>
            <ul>Day 1 - Theory and use cases</ul>
            <ul>Day 2 - Quantitative networks: social network analysis and network science</ul>
            <ul>Day 3 - Building, refining and serving a knowledge graph from end-to-end</ul>
            <ul>Day 4 - Graph machine learning from traditional graph ML to graph neural networks (GNNs)</ul>
            <ul>Day 5 - Full-stack graph ML applications</ul>
        </li>
    </div>

<div>Students begin Day 0 setup before the course and we debug by email. At the start of Day 1 we will verify everything works for all students.</div>

    <h2 id="problem-definition">Who should attend this course?</h2>

    This course is for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to extend their work with data tables and DataFrames to datasets with a relational or graph structure - entities (nodes/vertices) and their connections (edges/links).

    Beginning with a grounding in theory and real-world use cases, we will build knowledge graphs using natural language processing (NLP), analyze networks using graph analytics and extract the full potential of relational structures in data by automating business procsses using graph machine learning including graph kernels, embeddings and graph neural networks (GNNs). When the course is completed, you will be able to incorporate graph machine learning in your daily work to build more powerful models and systems.
</div>

<div>
    <h2 id="problem-definition">What skills are required to be successful in this course?</h2>

    The course focuses on the Python data stack, students should be able to write Python programs. They should be grounded in data science or statistics using data tables like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> DataFrames. They should be familiar with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/index.html">Databricks</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index.html">Snowflake</a> or other notebooks. Some exposure to traditional machine learning concepts and tools like scikit-learn is necessary, but expertise is NOT required. Mathematics are helpful for attaining intuition but a basic grasp of graphs and vectors will be sufficient for a working knowledge as we employ visualizations to assist with intuitive learning of concepts.
